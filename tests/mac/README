This is a sample mac project, to illustrate how to create a MAC around a Ziria PHY. 
This is a dummy MAC that runs two Ziria files, rx.zir and tx.zir. 
It can be run in a single thread or on two threads. 
In the single thread mode we run tx.zir on data, store data in memory, run rx.zir on the memory buffer and store output. 
In the 2 threaded mode we run the same process on two threads, where rx.zir threads waits for the tx thread to finish
before processing the data. 
The goal of the project is to illustrate different initializations and interfacing between components. 
It has been used to derive WiFi MAC in code/WiFi/mac.
