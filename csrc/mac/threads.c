// ***************
// We use standard Windows thread with core affinity and real-time priority
// There doesn't seem to be much difference between the two.
// Sora threads were using fibers to move the running thread from a core to another core
// occasionally, to avoid Windows killing it for overusing a CPU
// This does not seem to happen in Win8 anymore. 
// A real-time thread gets preemted only by other real-time threads (e.g. svchost and dvm)
// and there doesn't seem to be any other negative implication of sticking forever to one core. 
// Below are the measurements from MSRC-Sora12 (Dell T3500):
// Sora single thread (no calls to SoraThreadYield): 
//   preempted: (53.4us, 8us, 8us, 139us) each ~30ms by processes: svchost, dwm
// Sora with SoraThreadYield (moved from core to core to avoid punishments): 
//   preempted: (46us, 30us, 10us) each ~30ms by processes: svchost, dwm
// Win single thread: 
//   preemted: (9.3us, 8.9us, 18.6us) each ~90ms by processes : svchost, dwm
