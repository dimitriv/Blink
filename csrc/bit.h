/* Note: Representation of bits and bit arrays
 * 
 * Bits are represented as 1 byte (char), with the LSB denoting the actual bit.
 *
 * Bit arrays (of a statically known length N) are represented as arrays of chars. 
 * Indexing starts from the LSB of lowest-address byte (index 0), towards the MSB,
 * and continues this way for higher addressed. The final byte may only be "partially"
 * filled in, with the payload residing in its least significant bits.
