This directory contains C library files that linked to Ziria code, 
and C driver files that run Ziria code.

Library files:
- buf_*.c: read/write operations for various data types and for 
  various input/output devices (file, memory, Sora, dummy...)

- wpl_alloc: fast memory management library for Ziria

- utils.c: Various utility functions written in standard C

- numerics.c: Standard arithmetic over Ziria data types (e.g. complex)

- ext_*.c: various library files that are written in standard C
  and should be platform independent
  * extp_arr.c: array operations
  * ext_math.c: math operations (fixed-point trigonometry)

- sora_*: various library files that are written for Windows (7/8)
  and rely on having Sora library installed
  * sora_radio.c: interface with Sora radio hardware
  * sora ip.c: interface with NDIS, Windows networking stack
  * sora_threads.c: Methods for running code in real-time threads
    (note: all Ziria code runs within a real-time thread pinned to a core)
  * sora_thread_queues.c: port of Sora inter-thread queues to C 
    (to avoid polymorphism)
  

Driver files:
- driver.c: File with main(). Parses parameters, initialized the environment
  and run Ziria code in a single, real-time thread. 
  Note: this is a default driver. For more complex MAC, this file should
  be replaced with a custom MAC (for examples see csrc/mac or code/Wifi/testbed).

- params.c: Parses command line parameters and
