The examples in this directory are from MSR India summer school 2014, and are discussed in the slides/course.
The examples are in files ex_*.zir. Other files are copied from WiFi, for completeness.
Various examples are preceded by a comment describing the slide the example refers to. 
To run the example uncomment the code under the comment.
Use make ex_*.outfile to compile and run the programs (tests don't exist here). 
To visualize the output, add a pause (e.g. getch()) at the end of driver.c. Otherwise DbgPlot will not have enough time to initialize the graph before the program ends.
