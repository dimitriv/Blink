Ziria is a programming language and compiler for low-level bitstream processing.


Some useful information:

* Top-level directory structure:

     src/    Haskell source code
   tools/    A few useful tools 
     lib/    Some simple libraries
    csrc/    C code and C libraries
   tests/    Testsuite 
    code/    WiFi implementation code
     doc/    Various documentation and design notes
 scripts/    Various scripts for building in different environments

* Building the compiler: see BUILD

* Running the basic tests:

  Pre-requisites: You must have gcc installed in your Linux or Cygwin 
  environment. Go to tests/backend or tests/parser and type 'make'.

  Ziria compiler (wplc) produces C source code that needs to be
  further compiled with a C compiler. We currently support 3 C
  environments: gcc, WinDDK v7 and Visual Studio.  In order to use
  WinDDK, you need to set WINDDK_ROOT path.  In order to use VS, you
  need to set ZIRIA_VS to point to where vcvarsall.bat file is located
  (e.g. ZIRIA_VS="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
  12.0\VC" for VS2013). To use different C compiler with tests, run:

    COMPILER={gcc,winddk,vs} make


* Running the WiFi tests:

  To compile and run performance tests and the WiFi testsuite (in
  code/WiFi) you must have SORA installed. We currently support Sora
  2.0, although older versions can easily be adapted.  To build Sora,
  you need WinDDK version 7 (see Sora pages for more details).  Once
  Sora is build, you can use either WinDDK or Visual Studio
  environments. More documentation can be found in doc/
