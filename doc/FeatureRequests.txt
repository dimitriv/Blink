List of features that we hope to add to Ziria at some point:

- More graceful automatic type casting. For example, x_int32 + x_int16 should automatically result 
  into y_int32 and not error.

- Support constant expressions wherever a literal is expected (e.g. var x:arr[const] int 
  and a[0,const] := b[0,const] and x<-takes const).

- Correct file and line number reporting on errors consistently through Ziria. 
  For example, bounds checking only reports line number from the expanged file.
  Type checking seems to also report a line number from the expanded file. 

- Array sizes are dynamically bound in function input but not in function output. 
  It seems that we cannot declare a function that return an array of unspecified size.
