List of features that we hope to add to Ziria at some point:

- More graceful automatic type casting. For example, x_int32 + x_int16 should automatically result 
  into y_int32 and not error.

- Support constant expressions wherever a literal is expected (e.g. var x:arr[const] int 
  and a[0,const] := b[0,const] and x<-takes const).
